# jupyter-apis-homework
# I only made it through the weather part of the homework, which already took me quite a few hours.

# The assignment was "about" using the weather API to look for data about current weather, forecasts, and astronomical data by sorting through libraries and dictionaries. It was also an introduction to using Jupyter Notebook and uploading code to GitHub.

# I think I became a little more confident with locating specific pieces of data in APIs, which I really struggled with in the assignments last week. I had a few more "aha" moments, even though I wasn't quite able to answer everything.

# I'm still finding it challenging to know what the URL is. I think I have a pretty firm grasp of using lists and dictionaries, but I get really caught up on API keys, request URLs, etc. I got this wrong in the Do Now from Thursday as well. Could we spend some more time going over this in class?
